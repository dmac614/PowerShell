## Plan 

Rough idea -- this will be elaborated as time goes on

1. Get input about which workout was performed (date)? -- display the workouts
2. If workout X is selected, retrieve the data from the previous workout
3. Invoke methods to modify weight and reps
4. Write updated data to the new workout based on the date
5. Monitor progress: you have increased exercise X by X KG since (date)

Create the FullBody1 class first
Test the methods and properties
Create functions: UpdateWorkout; ? 

Structure:
Workout Date | Exercise | Reps | Weight | Notes
